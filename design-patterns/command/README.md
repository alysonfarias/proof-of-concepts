Pros
The command pattern allows us to decouple methods from the object that executes the operation. It gives you more control if you’re dealing with commands that have a certain lifespan, or commands that should be queued and executed at specific times.

Cons
The use cases for the command pattern are quite limited, and often adds unnecessary boilerplate to an application.
